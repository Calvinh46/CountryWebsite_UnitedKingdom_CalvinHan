          <p>In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the 
            two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.
            After the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars 
            (1792–1815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power 
            (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British 
            dominance was later described as the Pax Britannica ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace 
            amongst the great powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon
            and adopted the role of global policeman. From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the Crimean War, 
            allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 
            the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India. Alongside the formal
            control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it 
            effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America.
            Throughout the Victorian era (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies.
            Beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832, Parliament gradually widened the voting franchise, with the 1884 
            Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. 
            The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant 
            social and economic stresses. By the late 19th century the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli and 
            Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa, maintained a policy of "splendid isolation" 
            in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Persia, in what came 
            to be known as the Great Game. During this time Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing 
            dominion status. At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire 
            and the United States. The Edwardian era (1901–1910) included social reform and home rule for Ireland become 
            important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups 
            in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote. </p>
        
            <p>The culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by its combined nations' history, its interaction with the cultures of 
              Europe, the individual diverse cultures of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the impact of the British 
              Empire. The culture of the United Kingdom may also colloquially be referred to as British culture. Although British 
              culture is a distinct entity, the individual cultures of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are diverse. 
              There have been varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness between these four cultures. British literature is 
              particularly esteemed. The modern novel was developed in Britain, and playwrights, poets, and authors are among its 
              most prominent cultural figures. Britain has also made notable contributions to theatre, music, cinema, art, 
              architecture and television. The UK is also the home of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church in 
              Wales, the state church and mother church of the Anglican Communion, the third-largest Christian denomination.
              Britain contains some of the world's oldest universities, has made many contributions to philosophy, science, 
              technology and medicine, and is the birthplace of many prominent scientists and inventions. The Industrial 
              Revolution began in the UK and had a profound effect on socio-economic and cultural conditions around the world.
              British culture has been influenced by historical and modern migration, the historical invasions of Great Britain,
              and the British Empire. As a result of the British Empire, significant British influence can be observed in the language,
              law, culture and institutions of its former colonies, most of which are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. A subset 
              of these states form the Anglosphere, and are among Britain's closest allies. British colonies and dominions 
              influenced British culture in turn, particularly British cuisine. Sport is an important part of British culture, 
              and numerous sports originated in their organised, modern form in the country including cricket, football, boxing, 
              tennis and rugby. The UK has been described as a "cultural superpower", and London has been described as a world cultural capital.
              A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the UK ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada)
              in 2013 and 2014.</p>
