        <p>In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the 
          two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.
          After the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars 
          (1792–1815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power 
          (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British 
          dominance was later described as the Pax Britannica ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace 
          amongst the great powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon
          and adopted the role of global policeman. From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the Crimean War, 
          allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 
          the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India. Alongside the formal
          control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it 
          effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America.
          Throughout the Victorian era (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies.
          Beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832, Parliament gradually widened the voting franchise, with the 1884 
          Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. 
          The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant 
          social and economic stresses. By the late 19th century the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli and 
          Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa, maintained a policy of "splendid isolation" 
          in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Persia, in what came 
          to be known as the Great Game. During this time Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing 
          dominion status. At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire 
          and the United States. The Edwardian era (1901–1910) included social reform and home rule for Ireland become 
          important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups 
          in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote. </p>
