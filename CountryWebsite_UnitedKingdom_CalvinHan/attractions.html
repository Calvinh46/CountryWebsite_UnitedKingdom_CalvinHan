        <p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the Great Clock of Westminster, and, 
          by extension, for the clock tower which stands at the north end of the Palace of Westminster
          in London, England. Originally named the Clock Tower, the structure was renamed the Elizabeth Tower in 
          2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The clock is a striking clock with five bells.</p>

        <p>The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is 
          located in London, England. It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament after the House of 
          Commons and the House of Lords, the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. The palace 
          is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; "Westminster" has become a metonym 
          for the UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government 
          commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower of the palace, nicknamed Big Ben, is 
          a landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general. The palace has been a Grade I listed 
          building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.</p>

        <p>Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule, suspension, and, until 1960, cantilever bridge 
          in London, built between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry 
          with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and 
          is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the City Bridge Foundation, a charitable trust 
          founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to connect the 39% of London's population that lived 
          east of London Bridge, equivalent to the populations of "Manchester on the one side, and 
          Liverpool on the other", while allowing shipping to access the Pool of London between the 
          Tower of London and London Bridge. The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, 
          Princess of Wales, on 30 June 1894. The bridge is 940 feet (290 m) in length including the abutments
          and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal 
          walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically 
          powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is 
          part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and 
          remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible 
          to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine 
          rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.</p>

        <p>The London Eye, originally the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of
          the River Thames in London. It is the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel,
          and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over three million visitors annually.
          It has been featured numerous times in popular culture. The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel 
          has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel, 
          until the 160-metre (525 ft) Star of Nanchang in China surpassed it in 2006. Unlike taller wheels, the Eye is 
          cantilevered and supported solely by an A-frame on one side. The Eye was the highest public viewing point in London until 
          2013, when it was surpassed by the 245-metre (804 ft) View from The Shard observation deck. The London Eye adjoins 
          the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the 
          River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth. 
          The nearest tube station is Waterloo.</p>

        <p>The Natural History Museum in London is a museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural
          history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the
          Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road. The museum is home to 
          life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, 
          mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification 
          and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific 
          value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur 
          skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature—both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast 
          that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the 
          ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains an extensive collection of books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork
          linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is
          recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.</p>

        <p>The V&A is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area known as "Albertopolis"
          because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial, and the major cultural institutions
          with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall
          and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture,
          Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free.</p>
