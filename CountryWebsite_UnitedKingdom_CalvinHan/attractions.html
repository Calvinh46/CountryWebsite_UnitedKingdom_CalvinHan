        <p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the Great Clock of Westminster, and, 
          by extension, for the clock tower which stands at the north end of the Palace of Westminster
          in London, England. Originally named the Clock Tower, the structure was renamed the Elizabeth Tower in 
          2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The clock is a striking clock with five bells.</p>

        <p>The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is 
          located in London, England. It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament after the House of 
          Commons and the House of Lords, the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. The palace 
          is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; "Westminster" has become a metonym 
          for the UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government 
          commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower of the palace, nicknamed Big Ben, is 
          a landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general. The palace has been a Grade I listed 
          building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.</p>

        <p>Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule, suspension, and, until 1960, cantilever bridge 
          in London, built between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry 
          with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and 
          is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the City Bridge Foundation, a charitable trust 
          founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to connect the 39% of London's population that lived 
          east of London Bridge, equivalent to the populations of "Manchester on the one side, and 
          Liverpool on the other", while allowing shipping to access the Pool of London between the 
          Tower of London and London Bridge. The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, 
          Princess of Wales, on 30 June 1894. The bridge is 940 feet (290 m) in length including the abutments
          and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal 
          walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically 
          powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is 
          part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and 
          remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible 
          to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine 
          rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.</p>
