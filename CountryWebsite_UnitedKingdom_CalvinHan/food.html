       <p>The perfect comfort dish on a cold day, a typical fish and chip dinner will 
          consist of a large piece of white fish (usually cod or haddock) coated in batter 
          and deep-fried to crispy perfection. Traditionally, in the UK, the fish is served
          with chunky chips, never with fries.</p>

      <h2>#2:British Steak & Kidney Pie</h2>
    </div>  

    <div class="container">

      <div class="content">
       <p>The filling is composed of diced steak combined with chopped onion and kidney, 
        usually from a pig or lamb. This mixture is cooked with brown gravy, then encased in 
        pastry and baked. Or – in the case of steak and kidney pudding – steamed for several 
        hours in a suet pastry. Occasionally mushrooms are added, along with some type of ale.
        The kidneys lend a full, gamey flavor to the filling. It certainly tastes unique but 
        is quite delicious. It’s usually accompanied by mashed potatoes, green beans, and lots 
        of gravy.</p>

      <h2>#3:Full English Breakfast</h2>
    </div>

      <div class="content">
       <p>There’s no better way to start your day in the UK than with a 
        full English breakfast. The use of the word ‘full’ here is more 
        than appropriate. This is a feast of a meal that will quite possibly 
        keep you going right up until dinner time!
        A ‘full English’ is also known as a fry-up because of the method 
        used to cook the ingredients. It usually consists of bacon slices 
        (called rashers), sausages, eggs (fried, poached, or scrambled), 
        mushrooms, baked beans, fried or grilled tomatoes, black pudding, 
        and fried bread. As if all of this isn’t enough to fill you up, it 
        also comes with a side serving of hot buttered toast and a cup of 
        British tea!
        There are a few regional variations on the full English, with each 
        nation of the UK adding its own twist. The ‘full Scottish’ will usually 
        contain Tattie Scones (potato scones) and the square ‘Lorne sausage’. A
        ‘full Welsh’ may include laverbread along with locally sourced ingredients.
        A ‘full Irish’ is much more likely to contain white pudding than black 
        (white pudding contains no blood, just pork, spices, and oatmeal).</p>

      <h2>#4:Shepherds Pie</h2>

      <div class="content">
       <p>Shepherd’s Pie is a hearty meal containing a bottom layer of meat – 
        usually minced or diced lamb – cooked with onions and other vegetables 
        in a rich gravy. It’s then topped with a thick layer of mashed potato and 
        baked. Apparently, the recipe then made its way over to Ireland, where 
        potatoes were a favorite and staple food. The Irish decided to do away
        with the pastry topping and use a layer of mashed potato instead. This
        revision to the recipe has stuck ever since.</p>

      <h2>#5:Irish Stew</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="container">

      <div class="content">
       <p>There are two major components of the dish – meat and potatoes. Originally 
        the meat would have been mutton, which was widely available at that time. Indeed, 
        the peasants – who relied on their sheep for milk and wool – kept them well into their 
        old age, by which time the meat had to be stewed to be edible! Potatoes first arrived in 
        Ireland in the 16th century and went on to play a very significant part in the diet of 
        the working classes. To this day, Irish dishes tend to revolve around a central ingredient 
        of potatoes. Irish Stew is no exception, with purists saying that nothing more than meat 
        and onions should be added. These days, though, the stew tends to contain 
        additional root vegetables like carrots, parsnips, and turnips and the meat
         used is usually beef or lamb instead of mutton. Another modern (and very welcome) 
         variation is the addition of Guinness stout, which really helps increase the flavor of 
         the dish.</p>
